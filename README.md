# GROMACS RMSD Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This repository provides a scripts to handle and visualize Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) data from GROMACS `.xvg` files and other files like RMSF and RoG. The scripts is designed to process multiple files and plot them in a single, highly customizable graph using R and `ggplot2`. The graph is suitable for publication, offering detailed customization options for colors, legends, axis labels, and more.

## Features

- **RMSD File Handling**: The script reads `.xvg` files generated by GROMACS, cleans the data by removing headers and any `NA` values, and converts RMSD values from nanometers (nm) to Angstroms (Ã…).
- **Customizable Plotting**: The script uses `ggplot2` to create high-quality, customizable RMSD plots. You can easily change colors, axis scales, and legend positions.
- **Multiple RMSD Files**: The script allows for the combination of RMSD data from different simulations into a single plot, with each dataset distinguished by a unique color.

## Upcoming Features

In the future, this repository will also include scripts for visualizing other important molecular dynamics (MD) metrics, including:

- **Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF)**: Analysis of atomic fluctuations over time.
- **Radius of Gyration (RoG)**: A measure of the compactness of the structure over time.
- **Hydrogen Bonding Analysis**: Visualization of hydrogen bonds formed during the simulation.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your GROMACS `.xvg` files are correctly formatted. The script assumes any rows begin with # or @ as headers, which will be automatically removed.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the R script provided to load your `.xvg` files, clean the data, and generate RMSD plots.
3. **Customization**: Modify the `ggplot2` parameters in the script to fit your specific publication needs, such as changing colors, labels, and legend placement.

## Dependencies

- **R**: The script is written in R and requires the following packages:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`

## Example

The script includes an example that demonstrates how to load two RMSD `.xvg` files, clean them, and generate a combined RMSD plot with custom colors and legend placement.
